## Tool Description
Octo-web is a web-app that is based on Octosuite. When it was in production, It was a prototype so it did not have all the features needed to emulate Octosuite (https://github.com/bellingcat/octosuite).

## About
This was a tool I had made for one of Bellingcat's hackathons. The goal was to make Octosuite available for the web, and I succeeded in showing that it could
be done by giving the user the option to search for Github repositories in the same way that you would with Octosuite. 

I had intended to continue this and offer the full range of options you would have available with Octosuite, however this seems redundant given that a GUI is due to be released for Octosuite. 

Overall, it was a fun yet stressful weekend project that allowed me to brush up on my Python and get acquainted with Flask, if nothing else.
